# Species-Distribution-Modeling for Kit Foxes and the Sierra Nevada Red Fox

The kit fox, Vulpes macrotis, is a small canid often found in the San Joaquin Valley and
adjacent valleys in central California (Koopman et al., 2000). Currently, it is listed as a federally
endangered and threatened species in California, which can be attributed to profound habitat
loss (Williams and Fitton, 1997). In the 1950s, the San Joaquin kit fox populations began to
decline due to new industrial and urban developments. Additionally, during this time, the
introduction of livestock led to increases in the amount of livestock grazing, which is not thought
to be directly detrimental to kit foxes but may alter the abundance of prey species that depend
on vegetation. Of the currently existing kit fox populations, they are now found in arid
environments (Cypher et al., 2013). They are mostly localized more inland near central
California.

The primary prey items of kit foxes are Kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spp. and other small
mammals and rodents. Kit fox abundance and distribution is largely dependent on surrounding
prey availability, which in turn is dependent on a number of environmental factors (Cypher et al.,
2003). In particular, high precipitation levels with cool temperatures are known to negatively
impact small mammal abundance due to increases in flooding. On the other hand, high
precipitation levels also lead to increases in vegetation, which can also contribute to high small
mammal availability. We therefore predict that precipitation levels will be at least one of the main
factors that will contribute to our species distribution model of kit foxes in California because kit
fox abundance is dependent on prey availability. We hypothesize and expect to see a high
predicted distribution of kit foxes in areas where there are moderate amounts of precipitation. As
kit foxes are still currently endangered species, there is a critical need to better understand
which environmental variables can best predict the distribution of kit foxes.

The training data AUC was 0.927, and the test data AUC was 0.908. Because both the AUC values
of the training and test data are greater than 0.5, our model is fairly accurate in predicting the
distribution of kit foxes compared to a random kit fox distribution model.
